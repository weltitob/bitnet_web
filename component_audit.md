## Verification Process

For each component, we follow these steps:
1. Extract the exact HTML from the original file
2. Compare the styling (CSS properties, classes)
3. Ensure the React component renders identically
4. Verify animations and interactions match
5. Confirm text content is exactly the same
6. Check responsive behavior matches original
